This first blog post inaugurates our series named "This Month in hax":
a series of short highlights of what happened in the development of
hax and it's ecosystem in the month.

In June, 23 PRs have been merged ðŸŽ‰! The detail is available below.

On the Rust side, we have updated the Rust compiler to a very recent
nightly thanks to [@Nadrieril](https://github.com/Nadrieril)! We also
added support for more Rust features in the frontend ([`dyn
Trait`](https://github.com/hacspec/hax/pull/741)), [more disciminant
informations on ADTs](https://github.com/hacspec/hax/pull/693), fixed
various bugs, and improved the general experience of using hax.

We pushed many fixes for the F* backend in the engine and improved the
F* proof library. We also improved the bounded integer library and
it's F* integration.
