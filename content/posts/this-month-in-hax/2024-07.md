That's the second blog post of our "This Month in hax" series, and
this month, in july, we merged 32 PRs! ðŸŽ‰

On the side of the frontend and CLI, we had a lot of fixes and
improvements! The `hax` command line and rustc driver were
[refactored](https://github.com/hacspec/hax/pull/743), allowing for
better scaling and caching. We also improved the general ergonomics:
diagnostics can [now](https://github.com/hacspec/hax/pull/802) be
outputted in JSON, we have [improved error
messages](https://github.com/hacspec/hax/pull/796)... And we pushed
various bug fixes.

On the engine, we now [resugar
asserts](https://github.com/hacspec/hax/pull/794) properly and
[support `dyn`](https://github.com/hacspec/hax/pull/788). We also
pushed various enhancements (visitors for the internal AST are
generated again, we propagate some more trait generics arguments...)
and bug fixes.

On the thematic of libraries and helper macros, users can [now add
`requires` and `ensures`
clauses](https://github.com/hacspec/hax/pull/790) directly on traits.
