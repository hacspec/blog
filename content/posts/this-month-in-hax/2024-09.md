In July, we merged 33 PRs! ðŸŽ‰

On the side of the frontend, [Nadrieril](https://github.com/Nadrieril)
and I worked at making hax handling of binders (e.g. `'a` in `for<'a>
&'a T: PartialEq<i32>`) and traits better. This is not finished yet,
but we made great progress. Our goal is to make the frontend work on
every valid Rust code.

In the engine, thanks to [paulmure](https://github.com/paulmure), we
now are able to process `unsafe` blocks. Thanks to
[maximebuyse](https://github.com/maximebuyse), the engine can now
rewrite more `return` expressions: we are now planning on supporting
`return` inside loops, along with `break` and `continue`.

We've been improving F* support and F* libraries. Importantly,
[cmester0](https://github.com/gaetan-sbt) is working on a model of
`core`, in Rust: we aim at replacing our hand-crafted F* model of core
by an hax extraction of this new core model implemented in Rust. We
will also be able to extract this model of core in every of our
backends, enabling a uniform and pain-free `core` multi-backend
library.
