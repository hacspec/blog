In October, we merged 70 PRs! ðŸŽ‰

Thanks to a huge work from [Nadrieril](https://github.com/Nadrieril) on trait resolution, the goal of handling all valid Rust code with hax frontend is now almost achieved. With these improvements and some bugfixes from [W95Psp](https://github.com/W95Psp), we now produce JSON without errors for more than 99% of Rust's top 800 crates!

[W95Psp](https://github.com/W95Psp) worked on a new data representation for communication between the frontend and the engine. This removes redundancy and gives great performance gains. 

A new generic printer has been developed by [W95Psp](https://github.com/W95Psp) and is now available for backend development. The coq backend is the first to use it thanks to the migration work from [cmester0](https://github.com/cmester0).

I have worked on eliminating circular dependencies between the modules we generate. And also on allowing control flow (`return`, `break` and `continue`) inside loops.

Last but not least, the effort to release v0.1.0 is almost finished. This comes with documentation and tooling improvements. For example, [jschneider-bensch](https://github.com/jschneider-bensch) added a simple PSK based protocol as an example for the ProVerif backend.
