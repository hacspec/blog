This is the last post of this series for 2024.

During this somewhat brief December, as many take time off for the holidays, we merged 21 PRs.

The focus this month was largely on bug fixes, improvements, and general cleanups, with most of the work concentrated on the engine. However, a few frontend updates made their way in as well.

A notable contribution from [@maximebuyse](https://github.com/maximebuyse) introduces more consistent support for marking Rust items as opaque, establishing a unified approach to opaqueness across nearly all types of Rust items.

Additionally, weâ€™ve expanded our documentation. I began outlining the technical architecture of hax in the book, providing a clearer overview for those interested in the inner workings of the project.
